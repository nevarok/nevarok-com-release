It leverages a clipped surrogate objective function to ensure stable and efficient training. Here are the key features and parameters of the PPO algorithm used in NevarokML:</p> <ul> <li>policy (Policy): The policy model to use, such as MlpPolicy, CnnPolicy, etc. It determines the architecture and   learning capabilities of the agent's policy network.</li> <li>learningRate (Learning Rate): Set the learning rate for the PPO algorithm. It controls the step size during   optimization and affects the convergence speed and stability.</li> <li>nSteps (Number of Steps): Specify the number of steps to run for each environment per update. This determines the   size of the rollout buffer and influences the trade-off between bias and variance.</li> <li>batchSize (Batch Size): Set the minibatch size used for training. Larger batch sizes can improve training   stability but require more computational resources.</li> <li>nEpochs (Number of Epochs): Define the number of epochs when optimizing the surrogate loss. Each epoch consists of   multiple update steps on the collected samples.</li> <li>gamma (Discount Factor (Gamma)): Set the discount factor that determines the weight of future rewards compared to   immediate rewards. It influences the agent's preference for short-term or long-term rewards.</li> <li>gaeLambda (Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) Lambda): Specify the trade-off factor between bias and variance   for the Generalized Advantage Estimator. It affects how rewards are accumulated over time and influences the agent's   value function estimation.</li> <li>clipRange (Clip Range): Set the clipping parameter for the PPO objective. It restricts the policy update to a   certain range, preventing drastic policy changes.</li> <li>entCoef (Entropy Coefficient): Specify the entropy coefficient for the loss calculation. It encourages exploration   by adding an entropy term to the objective function.</li> <li>vfCoef (Value Function Coefficient): Set the value function coefficient for the loss calculation. It balances the   importance of the value function and the policy gradient during optimization.</li> <li>maxGradNorm (Maximum Gradient Norm): Specify the maximum value for gradient clipping. It prevents large updates   that could destabilize the training process.</li> <li>useSde (Use SDE): Enable the use of Generalized State Dependent Exploration (gSDE) instead of action noise   exploration.</li> <li>sdeSampleFreq (SDE Sample Frequency): Set the frequency to sample a new noise matrix when using gSDE.</li> <li>verbose (Verbose Level): Control the verbosity level of the training process.
